BQ76920 Battery Management System (BMS) Driver Documentation
============================================================

Overview
--------

Imagine you have a bunch of batteries powering something important, like a toy robot or an electric scooter. These batteries need someone to watch over them to make sure they don’t get too full (overcharged), too empty (drained), or too hot. That’s where the **BQ76920** chip comes in—it’s like a tiny babysitter for batteries! This project is a set of instructions (called a "driver") written in the C language that tells the **STM32 microcontroller** (a small computer brain) how to talk to the BQ76920 chip using a special wire called **I2C**.

Here’s what this driver can do:

*   **Wake up the BQ76920** and make sure it’s ready to work.
    
*   **Measure how full each battery cell is** (in volts).
    
*   **Check how much power is flowing** (in amps).
    
*   **Balance the batteries** so they all have about the same amount of energy.
    
*   **Watch for trouble** like batteries getting too full or too empty.
    

This driver is designed to work with the STM32 microcontroller, which is popular in things like robots, drones, and electric cars.

Dependencies
------------

To use this driver, you need:

*   **STM32 HAL Library**: This is like a helper kit that makes it easy for the STM32 to talk to other parts, like the BQ76920 chip over I2C.
    
*   **BQ76920 Chip**: The actual babysitter chip connected to your batteries.
    
*   **I2C Wires**: A way for the STM32 and BQ76920 to chat (like a phone line).
    

Register Definitions
--------------------

The BQ76920 chip has little "notebooks" inside it called **registers**. Each notebook has a number (address) and holds specific information. Here are the ones we use:

**Register NameAddressWhat It Does**SYS\_STAT\_REG0x00Tells us if something’s wrong (like a warning light).VC1\_HI\_REG0x0CHolds the voltage readings for the battery cells.CC\_HI\_REG0x32Shows how much current (power flow) is happening.CELLBAL1\_REG0x01Controls which batteries need balancing.SYS\_CTRL2\_REG0x05Lets us turn charging or discharging on/off.

Functions and Technical Details
-------------------------------

Here’s a breakdown of each function in simple terms, followed by the updated code with comments your mum could understand!

### 1\. BQ76920\_Init

*   **What It Does**: Says "hello" to the BQ76920 chip to make sure it’s awake and ready to help.
    
*   **How**: Sends a message over I2C to check the status notebook (SYS\_STAT\_REG).
    
*   **Returns**: "All good" (HAL\_OK) if it works, or an error if the chip doesn’t answer.
    

### 2\. BQ76920\_ReadVoltages

*   **What It Does**: Asks the BQ76920 how full each battery cell is and writes it down.
    
*   **How**: Reads 6 bytes starting from VC1\_HI\_REG, turns them into millivolts (mV), and saves them in a list.
    
*   **Returns**: "All good" if it worked, or an error if the chip didn’t reply.
    

### 3\. BQ76920\_ReadCurrent

*   **What It Does**: Checks how much power is flowing in or out of the batteries.
    
*   **How**: Reads 2 bytes from CC\_HI\_REG and turns them into milliamps (mA).
    
*   **Returns**: "All good" if successful, or an error if not.
    

### 4\. BQ76920\_BalanceCells

*   **What It Does**: Makes sure all batteries have about the same energy by draining the fuller ones a bit.
    
*   **How**: Finds the emptiest battery, then tells the chip to balance any battery 50 mV fuller by writing to CELLBAL1\_REG.
    
*   **Returns**: "All good" if it worked, or an error if not.
    

### 5\. BQ76920\_CheckProtection

*   **What It Does**: Looks at the battery voltages to see if any are too high or too low.
    
*   **How**: Compares each voltage to safety limits (OV\_THRESHOLD and UV\_THRESHOLD) and raises a flag if there’s trouble.
    
*   **Returns**: Nothing directly, but sets flags to warn us.
    

### Additional Functions (Added for Completeness)

*   **BQ76920\_CheckStatus**: Reads all the warning lights from the chip and logs them.
    
*   **BQ76920\_SetChargeEnable**: Turns charging or discharging on/off like a switch.
