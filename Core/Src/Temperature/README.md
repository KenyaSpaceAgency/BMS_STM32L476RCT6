README - Temperature Sensor Driver (TMP100)
===========================================

Overview
--------

This repository contains the implementation of a temperature sensor driver for the TMP100 digital temperature sensor using I2C communication. The temperature.c file provides a function to read temperature values from the sensor and convert them into degrees Celsius.

Files
-----

*   **temperature.c**: Contains the function Temperature\_Read to retrieve temperature readings from the TMP100 sensor.
    
*   **temperature.h**: The corresponding header file with function prototypes and necessary includes.
    

Hardware Details
----------------

The TMP100 is a digital temperature sensor that communicates over I2C. This implementation supports two possible I2C addresses:

*   0x48: Assigned when the address pin (A0) is low.
    
*   0x49: Assigned when the address pin (A0) is high.
    

The temperature register (TMP100\_TEMP\_REG) is located at 0x00 in the sensor’s memory map.

Functionality
-------------

### HAL\_StatusTypeDef Temperature\_Read(I2C\_HandleTypeDef \*hi2c, int16\_t \*temperature)

This function reads temperature data from the TMP100 sensor and converts it into degrees Celsius.

#### Parameters:

*   hi2c: Pointer to the I2C handle (I2C\_HandleTypeDef) for communication.
    
*   temperature: Pointer to an integer where the temperature value (in degrees Celsius) will be stored.
    

#### Process:

1.  Determines the sensor’s I2C address based on the hi2c handle.
    
2.  Sends an I2C read command to retrieve 2 bytes from the temperature register (0x00).
    
3.  Extracts the temperature value from the received data:
    
    *   The first byte contains the upper 8 bits of temperature data.
        
    *   The second byte contains the fractional part, but only the upper 4 bits are relevant.
        
    *   The raw temperature value is obtained by shifting and combining these bytes.
        
    *   The TMP100 has a resolution of **0.0625°C per bit**, so the raw value is multiplied by 0.0625 to get the final temperature.
        
4.  Returns HAL\_OK if successful, otherwise returns an error status.

Dependencies
------------

*   **HAL Library**: Uses the STM32 HAL I2C functions (HAL\_I2C\_Mem\_Read).
    
*   **I2C Configuration**: The MCU’s I2C peripheral must be properly initialized before calling Temperature\_Read.
    

Potential Improvements
----------------------

*   Implement support for other TMP100 registers (e.g., configuration settings, alert thresholds).
    
*   Add error handling and retry mechanisms for better reliability.
    
*   Optimize performance using DMA instead of blocking I2C reads.
    

Conclusion
----------

This implementation provides an efficient way to interface with the TMP100 sensor using STM32's I2C interface. It allows accurate temperature measurements, which can be used for thermal monitoring and control applications.
